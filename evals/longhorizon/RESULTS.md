## Run 1: 2026-09-29, Sonnet 5, Horizon with live Jev, one run per arm

| | Hidden tests at the end | Constraint violations | Turns | Tool calls | Horizon calls | Cost-equivalent | Tokens |

**Horizon made no difference to quality, and it cost more.** Both arms passed every hidden test after every session and kept every constraint.

Why:
1. **The baseline kept its own memory.** It wrote `NOTES.md` and `DESIGN.md` with the constraints and design, and read them in later sessions. That is the native project-memory mechanism `PROJECT.md` §2 already acknowledges.
2. **The early decision didn't bite.** Horizon's `evaluate_options` chose SQLite in session 1 (good). The baseline built a file-locking store that also survived 8 concurrent writers.
3. **Horizon's cross-session continuity never engaged (a product gap).** In all 8 Horizon sessions, the agent marked the task complete at the end of the session. The next session started a new task, so the session-1 goal and constraints were never shown to sessions 2–4. Horizon's task state is per task, but "come back tomorrow and continue" is how multi-session work actually happens.
4. **The overhead was real:** 17–24 extra Horizon calls, plus the deliberation they trigger (the notes Horizon arm spent 34 turns on session 3, against the baseline's 14).

**Caveat:** one run per arm, on two small scenarios. A strong model on small projects is exactly where a plain notes file is enough. The scenarios may be too easy to show a difference either way.
